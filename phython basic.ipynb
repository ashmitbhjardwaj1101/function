        "1. What is Python, and why is it popular ?\n",
        "  - Python is an interpreted, high-level programming language that is simple and easy to read. It is widely used because of its simple syntax, flexibility, and vast libraries, making it suitable for web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, automation, and many more. Its popularity stems from its extensive community and versatility of applications.\n",
        "2. What is an interpreter in Python ?\n",
        "  - An interpreter in Python is a program running on a computer that executes Python code line by line and interprets it into machine code. It allows for immediate code execution, and therefore Python is an interpreted language.\n",
        "3. What are pre-defined keywords in Python ?\n",
        "  - In Python, predefined keywords are reserved words that carry specific meanings and are utilized to specify the syntax and structure of the language. These keywords cannot be used as variable names. Some of the prominent examples are \\\"if\\\", \\\"else\\\", \\\"while\\\", \\\"for\\\", \\\"def\\\", \\\"class\\\", \\\"import\\\", \\\"True\\\", \\\"False\\\", \\\"None\\\", and \\\"return\\\". These keywords manage control flow, specify functions, manage exceptions, and do a lot more.\n",
        "4. Can keywords be used as variable names ?\n",
        "- No, keywords cannot be used as variable names in Python. They are reserved words with special meanings that define the language’s syntax and structure. Using them as variable names will result in a syntax error.\n",
        "5. What is mutability in Python ?\n",
        "- Mutability in Python refers to whether an object’s value can be changed after creation. Mutable objects (e.g., lists, dictionaries, sets) can be modified, while immutable objects (e.g., strings, tuples, integers) cannot be altered once created.\n",
        "6. Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable ?\n",
        "- signed for dyLists are mutable because they are denamic data, allowing modifications like adding, removing, or changing elements. Tuples are immutable to ensure data integrity and allow for hashable keys in dictionaries, making them more memory-efficient and faster.\n",
        "7. What is the difference between “==” and “is” operators in Python ?\n",
        "- The \\\"==\\\" operator checks if values of two objects are equal, while the \\\"is\\\" operator checks if they refer to the same memory location (identity).\n",
        "8. What are logical operators in Python ?\n",
        "- Logical operators in Python are used to combine conditional statements. They include:  \\n\",\n",
        "    \"- **and**: Returns 'True' if both conditions are true.  \\n\",\n",
        "    \"- **or**: Returns 'True' if at least one condition is true.  \\n\",\n",
        "    \"- **not**: Returns 'True' if the condition is false, and vice versa.  \\n\",\n",
        "    \"These operators are commonly used in decision-making and control flow.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is type casting in Python ?\n",
        " - Type casting in Python is the process of converting one data type into another. It can be done using functions like int(), float(), str(), list(), and tuple(). For example, int(\\\"10\\\") converts the string \\\"10\\\" into an integer.   \n",
        "10.  What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting?\n",
        "- Implicit type casting is done automatically by Python, where it converts a smaller data type to a larger one (e.g., int to float) to avoid data loss.\\n\",\n",
        "    \"Explicit type casting is manually done by the programmer using functions like int(), float(), or str() to convert between data types.\n",
        "11. What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python ?\n",
        "-  Conditional statements in Python are used to execute specific code blocks based on whether a condition is true or false. They control the flow of the program using if, elif, and else statements.\n",
        "12.  How does the elif statement work ?\n",
        "- The elif statement in Python is used to check multiple conditions after an if statement. If the if condition is False, Python checks the elif condition. If it’s True, the corresponding block executes. Multiple elif statements can be used, and an optional else can handle cases when none are True.\n",
        "13. What is the difference between for and while loops ?\n",
        "-  A **for loop** is used for iterating over a sequence (e.g., list, tuple, string) and runs a fixed number of times.\\n\",\n",
        "    \"\\n\",\n",
        "    \"A **while loop** executes as long as a condition is true, making it suitable for indeterminate iterations.\n",
        "14. Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop ?\n",
        "- A **while loop** is more suitable when the number of iterations is unknown beforehand. For example, reading user input until they enter a valid value or processing data until a condition is met.\n",
